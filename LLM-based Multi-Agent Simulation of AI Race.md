#### Abstract

The immense potential of AIs has created competitive pressures among global players - corporations, militaries and nation states - contending for power and influence. This leads to escalation dynamics where each actor responds to others raising the stakes of a crisis or conflict, ultimately leading to an uncontrolled spiral and dangerous outcomes.

In this paper, we propose an LLM-powered multi-agent AI game, to simulate the participating actors, their decisions and the consequences. The game will incorporate strategies covering both system dynamics and heterogeneous agent-based modeling techniques. By evaluating the game trajectories and outcomes, we propose to identify novel risks and classify them for further analysis.

In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to escalations and risk realization. Our findings will offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can inform how we approach AI Race dynamics and further develop specific mitigation strategies and governance mechanisms.

# Introduction

AI is poised to become a powerful technology in near future, and as with any powerful technology the potential to harm is immense. As we consider risks arising from both present-day AIs and AIs that are likely to exist in the near future, it is paramount that we take into account the societal and economic structures of our society, the competitive pressures guiding various actors which can lead to emergent behavior and outcomes.

As AI systems approach transformative capabilities, the competitive pressures between organizations and nations create complex game-theoretic scenarios with potentially catastrophic failure modes. These dynamics mirror historical precedents such as nuclear arms races, where individually rational decisions can produce collectively suboptimal or dangerous outcomes. The phenomenon commonly termed the "AI race" represents a multi-stakeholder prisoner's dilemma at a global scale. Competitive pressures incentivize rapid deployment with reduced safety margins, while regulatory frameworks struggle to establish binding coordination mechanisms. 

This paper argues that understanding these dynamics requires modeling approaches that can represent bounded rationality in decision-making processes, information asymmetry between actors and path-dependent outcomes with non-linear state transitions. We propose an LLM-driven multi-agent simulation framework specifically designed to model these dynamics. Unlike traditional game-theoretic models that rely on simplified payoff matrices and rationality assumptions, our approach leverages the semantic reasoning capabilities of language models to simulate nuanced decision processes with realistic cognitive constraints.

# Desired Outcomes

# Software Architecture

Our system is a multi-agent system designed to automate qualitative, open-ended game scenarios by generating textual output based on reasoning from textual input without needing any task-specific training data. The architecture comprises three primary agent categories:

1. Strategic Actors: These include corporate entities (research laboratories, technology corporations, startups) and governmental actors (nation-states, regulatory bodies) encoded with parametric characteristics that constrain their action space and influence behavioral tendencies as scenarios evolve.
2. Coalition Entities: These simulate collective decision-making bodies that must formulate joint responses through internal negotiation processes. Coalitions may comprise multiple individual actors with potentially competing objectives.    
3. Control Mechanisms: These agents orchestrate simulation dynamics, including event adjudication, scenario progression, and maintaining causal consistency throughout the simulation space.    

The system implements a sequential turn-based protocol where:

1. The event simulation module generates stochastic or deterministic events based on the current system state.    
2. Strategic actors generate responses conditioned on their individual characteristics, historical context, and asymmetric information access.    
3. Control mechanisms adjudicate outcomes by generating coherent narrative progressions that represent plausible consequences of actor decisions.    
4. The system state updates to reflect new equilibrium conditions.    

This architecture enables exploration of complex, multi-dimensional strategy spaces that would be computationally intractable in traditional simulation paradigms.

## High level approach
- The event simulation module generates specific events/incidents based on the game state and the assessment of the global environment. These events are processed by the control agent and shared with the players & teams.
- The main task of each player/team is to state how they would respond to each situation based on the historical context available to them (through historian) and their own agent persona. 
- The control calls each player to find out what actions they propose in response to the current situation. The control then generates a plausible narrative of the outcome, describing what could reasonably happen as the players’ stated plans are carried out
- Specific player types, such as nation state, can also process the plausible narrative of the outcome generated by control and generate a new situation (event/incident). It can further select key players in that situation and specify additional information that can be shared only with them. This will result in specific "story plots" that will be injected in the history-stream of those player.
