LLM-based multi-agent simulation of AI Race dynamics to uncover and evaluate AI Risks

## Introduction
Working paper here: [LLM-based Multi-Agent Simulation of AI Race](https://github.com/ajaybha/ai-race-simulation/blob/main/LLM-based%20Multi-Agent%20Simulation%20of%20AI%20Race.md)

#### Abstract
The immense potential of AIs has created competitive pressures among global players - corporations, militaries and nation states - contending for power and influence. This leads to escalation dynamics where each actor responds to others raising the stakes of a crisis or conflict, ultimately leading to an uncontrolled spiral and dangerous outcomes.

In this paper, we propose an LLM-powered multi-agent AI game, to simulate the participating actors, their decisions and the consequences. The game will incorporate strategies covering both system dynamics and heterogeneous agent-based modeling techniques. By evaluating the game trajectories and outcomes, we propose to identify novel risks and classify them for further analysis.

In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to escalations and risk realization. Our findings will offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can inform how we approach AI Race dynamics and further develop specific mitigation strategies and governance mechanisms.
